APB PROTOCOL:
.LOW BANDWIDTH PROTOCOL, NON-PARALLED
EVERY TANSACTION TAKES ATLEAST 2 CLK CYCLES

STATES:
IDLE STATE - NO TRANSACTION IS OCCURING
SETUP PHASE - WHERE THE REQUESTER DRIVES SOME SIGNALS LIKE PADDR,PWRITE,PWDATA,PSTRB.
ACCESS PHASE - IT IS A SEQUENT OF SETUP PHASE, WHERE REQUESTER DRIVES THE PENBLE. FROM THIS TIMESTAMP TO PREADY ACTIVE , ALL THE SIGNALS MUST BE STABLE.


SIGNALS DESCRIPTIONS:
PCLK : WHERE ALL THE SIGNALS ARE TIMED TO IT. (RISING EDGE)
PRESETMn : SYNCHRONOUS RESET
PSELx : INDICATES WHICH PERIPHERAL TO SELECT.
PADDR : ADDRESS OF THE SLAVE CONTROL REGISTER/MEMORY
PWRITE : 1 - WRITE Tx 0 - READ Tx
PWDATA : IF PWRITE IS ACTIVE, THE PWDATA IS SAMPLED BY THE SLAVE
PENABLE : IT INDICATES THE SECOND OR SUBSEQUENT CYCLES OF AN APB TRANSFER
PPROT(3) : 0 -(NORMAL/PREVILEG) 1- (SECURE/NON-SECURE) 2- (DATA /INSTRUCTION ACCESS)
PNSE : AN EXTENSION TO THE PPROT
PSTRB(4) : INDICATES THE LANES OF THE DATA IS VALID
PREADY - IT IS USED TO EXTEND AN APB TANSFER
PRDATA - THE DATA FROM THE PADDR IS ASSERTED
PSLVERR - IF ANY INVALID Tx OCCURS PSLVERR IS ASSERED
PWAKEUP -
PAUSER - USER REQUEST
PWUSER - USER WRITE REQUEST
PRUSER - USER READ REQUEST
PBUSER - USER RESPONSE
